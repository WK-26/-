EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Civilization is built not by states but by individuals. Each person functions
as a structural “cell” that can be functional (healthy), silent (inactive),
or cancerous (replicating harmful patterns). This white paper presents the
Individual Civilization Health Check Model (ICHC), a quantitative framework
for diagnosing the structural health of individuals and their net impact on
humanity.

Six core indices:
• FFI (Functional Fabric Index): constructive capacity.
• CSI (Cancerous Structure Index): structural toxicity.
• CHS (Civilization Health Score) = FFI − CSI.
• EOI (Effectiveness of Influence): amplification power.
• RUI (Reverse Unification Index): virulence of harmful spread.
• HCCI (Human Civilization Contribution Index) = CHS × RUI.

The model provides rubrics, formulas, and workflows to identify functional
contributors, detect high-risk spreaders, and guide resource allocation,
alignment for AI systems, and civil society immune design. It avoids moral
labeling and focuses strictly on structural patterns, diffusion mechanisms,
and measurable outcomes.

=================================================================
ABSTRACT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Individual Civilization Health Check Model (ICHC) evaluates the health of
individuals as structural cells of civilization. It integrates six indices—FFI,
CSI, CHS, EOI, RUI, and HCCI—to quantify net impact on civilizational health.
FFI scores constructive capacity; CSI captures harmful replications; CHS is
the net balance; EOI measures amplification; RUI converts harmful capacity
into virulent spread; HCCI fuses net health with virulence to yield final
lifetime impact. The framework supplies rubrics, measurement protocols, and
safeguards to ensure transparent, auditable use in governance, AI alignment,
and civil society.

Keywords: Civilization, Individual, Immunity, Functional Fabric, Cancerous
Structure, CHS, EOI, RUI, HCCI, Kong Weicheng.

=================================================================
PREFACE — WHY AN “INDIVIDUAL CIVILIZATION HEALTH CHECK”?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
• Civilization is not an abstraction of borders or flags; it is the sum of
  billions of individual structures. Healthy individuals create resilient
  systems; unhealthy ones corrode them.
• We possess diagnostics for physiology but lack diagnostics for structural
  behavior. Yet structural “tumors” (hierarchy obsession, coercive language,
  emotional manipulation) are early warning signs of authoritarian drift,
  mass polarization, and institutional collapse.
• This model equips societies and AI systems to detect and counter structural
  hazards early—before metastasis—while elevating healthy structural patterns.

Core questions the model answers:
1) Is this person structurally healthy, silent, or cancerous?
2) What is their amplification power (EOI)?
3) How virulently would harmful patterns spread (RUI)?
4) What is their net lifetime impact on humanity (HCCI)?

=================================================================
CHAPTER 1 — ARCHITECTURE & FOUNDATIONAL LOGIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Structural Mechanics, Not Morality
   The ICHC model assesses structural patterns and diffusion, independent of
   identity, belief, or status. A person may be “moral” yet structurally
   harmful via coercive memes; or “unknown” yet structurally vital.

2. Six Indices & Balance Sheet View
   • FFI = assets (constructive capacity)
   • CSI = liabilities (harmful replication)
   • CHS = net equity (FFI − CSI)
   • EOI = amplifier (network position & leverage)
   • RUI = virulence (nonlinear spread of harm)
   • HCCI = final impact (CHS × RUI)

3. Measurement Principles
   • Parsimony: use concise rubrics with operational definitions.
   • Transparency: document sources, assumptions, evidence.
   • Calibration: tune thresholds with domain data and audits.
   • Non-punitiveness: diagnostic purpose; incorporate appeals and redress.

=================================================================
CHAPTER 2 — FFI: FUNCTIONAL FABRIC INDEX
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Definition
FFI measures how an individual strengthens civilizational structure: freedom,
dignity, cooperation, truth, and resilience.

Scoring
Eight primary dimensions, each 1–10. Total FFI = average of eight.

D1. Structural Cognition
   Subindicators (score each 1–10):
   - Power recognition & institutional understanding
   - Language-structure awareness (detecting coercion in speech)
   - Systemic thinking (feedback loops, incentives, externalities)
   Examples: 1 = naïve to power dynamics; 10 = identifies covert coercion,
   proposes structural remedies.

D2. Diversity Acceptance
   - Identity inclusion, cultural understanding, non-exclusiveness
   - Building non-homogeneous collaboration
   - Anti-stereotype behavior
   Ex: 1 = exclusionary, purity-seeking; 10 = actively integrates plurality.

D3. Emotional Regulation & Rational Expression
   - Calm communication; de-escalation; boundary awareness
   - Uses emotion for empathy, not control
   - Evidence-based discourse under pressure
   Ex: 1 = shaming, rage control; 10 = firm, respectful, reason-led.

D4. Collaboration & Public Participation
   - Trust-building; commons contribution; volunteerism
   - Initiating cooperative projects; transparent decision habits
   - Protecting public goods over factional gain
   Ex: 1 = freeloading/factionalism; 10 = sustained commons work.

D5. Autonomy & Anti-Authoritarian Dependence
   - Critical thinking; independent judgment
   - Resisting conformity pressure; whistleblowing courage
   - Avoids cults of personality or fatalism
   Ex: 1 = obedience-seeking; 10 = principled autonomy.

D6. Aesthetic & Cultural Creativity
   - Original expression; vocabulary innovation; culture-making
   - Cross-pollination of disciplines; open licensing ethos
   Ex: 1 = derivative propaganda; 10 = emancipatory cultural output.

D7. Structural Protection Behavior
   - Defends rule-of-law, due process, and open information
   - Protects the vulnerable; counters disinformation
   - Intervenes at critical moments to uphold structure
   Ex: 1 = bystander to harm; 10 = documented structural defense.

D8. Growth & Self-Correction
   - Learnability; feedback seeking; course correction
   - Admits error; updates models; mentors others
   Ex: 1 = brittle certainty; 10 = antifragile learning.

Interpretation (Total FFI)
   • 8.0–10.0: High functional contributor
   • 5.0–7.9 : Moderately functional/neutral-positive
   • ≤ 4.9   : Dormant/regressive; risk of silent drift

=================================================================
CHAPTER 3 — CSI: CANCEROUS STRUCTURE INDEX
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Definition
CSI measures structural harm potential—patterns that replicate coercion and
fragility in others and systems.

Scoring
Eight primary dimensions, each 1–10. Total CSI = average of eight.

C1. Structural Absolutism
   - Naturalizing hierarchy; sacred orders; unquestionable doctrines
   - “Only one truth/authority” frame

C2. Power Worship
   - Deference to coercive power; status obsession; sycophancy
   - Admiration of domination over legitimacy

C3. Emotional Manipulation
   - Fear, shame, guilt as tools; gaslighting; moral coercion
   - Conditional “love” for obedience

C4. Hierarchical Language Use
   - Dominance–submission verbs; “must/obedience/know your place”
   - Framing disagreement as disloyalty

C5. Normative Moralism
   - Rigid virtue policing; punishment-first stance
   - Erases context/complexity; suppresses dissent

C6. Rejection of Pluralism
   - Xenophobia/sectarianism; demonization of difference
   - “Purity” narratives; informational quarantine

C7. Zero-Sum Social Logic
   - Win–lose fixation; hostile attribution bias
   - Anti-cooperation; “ends justify means”

C8. Structural Replication
   - Recreating toxic control across domains (family, school, work, media)
   - Colonizes new contexts with old oppression

Interpretation (Total CSI)
   • 8.0–10.0: Highly carcinogenic (systemic disruptor)
   • 5.0–7.9 : Latent replicator (expansion risk)
   • 3.0–4.9 : Dormant/neutral carrier
   • < 3.0   : Low-risk; reversible with growth

Typical Hazard Contexts & Signals
   - “Obedience = love,” loyalty tests, manufactured enemies, sacredized leaders
   - Corporate “family” rhetoric masking exploitation
   - Shaming speech online; “if you don’t love X, leave”

=================================================================
CHAPTER 4 — CHS: CIVILIZATION HEALTH SCORE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Definition
CHS is the net structural health of an individual.

Formula
CHS = FFI − CSI

Interpretable Bands (derived from normalized 1–10 inputs)
   +7 to +9 : Deep structural health (resilient, role-model)
   +4 to +6 : Evident health (strong cooperative contributor)
   +1 to +3 : Basic health (locally positive; growth room)
    0       : Equilibrium (observe context)
   −1 to −3 : Mild cancer drift (early warning)
   −4 to −6 : Mid-level drift (intervene)
   −7 to −9 : Deep structural cancer (systemic damage)

Use
   - Selection: leadership/mentorship bias toward high CHS
   - Support: coaching for mid-tier; protection from high-risk spillover
   - Containment: restrict amplification of negative CHS where due process allows

=================================================================
CHAPTER 5 — EOI: EFFECTIVENESS OF INFLUENCE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Definition
EOI quantifies amplification—how far and how deeply a person’s structure
propagates through networks and institutions.

Nonlinear Amplifier Model
   EOI = (R × C × S × F × I × L) × T^1.3

Parameters (guidelines; calibrate with data)
   • R (Reach): audience magnitude (10^1 … 10^9)
   • C (Cognitive Penetration): depth of mindshare (0.2 … 0.9)
   • S (Structural Penetration): institutional access (0.1 … 1.0)
   • F (Frequency × Duration): cadence × longevity (1 … 500)
   • I (Information Amplification): virality/memetic weight (1 … 1000)
   • L (Leverage Position): proximity to decision nodes (1 … 1000)
   • T (Network Amplification): centrality/topology (0.8 … 3.0), exponent 1.3

Examples (orders of magnitude; illustrative)
   • Leader with mass platform: EOI ~ 10^15–10^18
   • Public intellectual (regional): EOI ~ 10^7–10^10
   • Local organizer: EOI ~ 10^3–10^5
   • Private citizen (offline): EOI ~ 10^1–10^3

=================================================================
CHAPTER 6 — RUI: REVERSE UNIFICATION INDEX
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Definition
RUI measures how intensely harmful structure spreads outward, given CSI and EOI.

Core Variable
   B = CSI × EOI

Nonlinear Virulence Function
   RUI = B × (1 + B^0.1)

Rationale
   Small increases in B can yield explosive spread due to network effects.
   Nonlinearity captures memetic epidemics.

Risk Levels (illustrative; domain calibration needed)
   • Low:        RUI < 10^4
   • Moderate:   10^4 ≤ RUI < 10^8
   • High:       10^8 ≤ RUI < 10^12
   • Extreme:    RUI ≥ 10^12

Always interpret RUI with CHS:
   High RUI with negative CHS = high-priority threat.
   High RUI with positive CHS = major civilizational asset.

=================================================================
CHAPTER 7 — HCCI: HUMAN CIVILIZATION CONTRIBUTION INDEX
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Definition
Final net impact of an individual on humanity.

Two Equivalent Forms
   1) HCCI = CHS × RUI
   2) HCCI = (FFI − CSI) × [ (CSI × EOI) × (1 + (CSI × EOI)^0.1) ]

Bands (tunable)
   • Civilization Pillar:        HCCI ≥ +1000
   • Neutral/Bystander:         −10 < HCCI < +10
   • High-Risk Spreader:        −1000 < HCCI ≤ −100
   • Civilization Core Cancer:  HCCI ≤ −1000

=================================================================
CHAPTER 8 — SCORE LEVELS & STRUCTURAL CLASSIFICATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Functional Cells
   - High FFI, low CSI → positive CHS; EOI aligned to transparency/cooperation.
   - HCCI typically positive even at modest EOI.
   - Backbone of resilient systems.

2) Silent Cells
   - Low activity; minimal FFI/CSI; EOI ≈ 0.
   - Non-toxic but structurally inactive; susceptible to drift in toxic climates.

3) Cancerous Individuals
   - High CSI; frequently high EOI via power/platforms.
   - Normalize fear/shame/hierarchy; colonize new contexts with control memes.

4) Civilizational Guardians (High CHS × High EOI)
   - Proactively reduce hierarchy, defend dignity, and scale immune logic.

5) High-Risk Spreaders (Negative CHS × High EOI)
   - Large-scale diffusion of structural harm; priority for containment under
     transparent, lawful processes.

Transitional States
   - Individuals can move categories with education, accountability, incentives.
   - Provide off-ramps for recovery; avoid fatalism.

=================================================================
CHAPTER 9 — PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Governance & Public Service
   - Use CHS/EOI/HCCI for selection and role fit (with due process).
   - Limit amplification (EOI) of recurrent negative-HCCI actors via transparent
     rules; support rehabilitation pathways.

2) AI Alignment & Safety
   - Penalize high-CSI/high-EOI patterns in training corpora.
   - Add CHS/RUI/HCCI checks into model outputs and agent plans.
   - Embed structural immunity principles at policy level.

3) Media & Platform Governance
   - Adjust recommendation weights away from structural pollutants.
   - Elevate high-CHS content; diversify sources to reduce echo chambers.

4) Education & Civil Society
   - Teach structural literacy (power, language, emotion, institutions).
   - Build decentralized immune networks for early detection and response.

5) Organizational Use
   - Leadership pipelines favor high CHS; ethics reviews for high EOI roles.
   - Incident postmortems include CSI source analysis and repairs.

Safeguards
   - Transparency, appeal rights, independent audits, proportional responses.

=================================================================
CHAPTER 10 — FUTURE OUTLOOK
-----------------------------------------------------------------
• Structural recognition will replace ideological policing.
• Everyone will know their structural identity code (CHS, EOI, RUI, HCCI).
• Politics will shift from identity fights to structural health design.
• Survival hinges on millions of structurally awakened individuals, not
  singular heroes.
